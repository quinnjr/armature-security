# Changelog — `armature-security`

All notable changes to this crate will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this crate adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Earlier changes are recorded in the workspace [`CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **Breaking:** `allow_credentials(true)` now clears `allow_any_origin` (and vice versa), and the preflight/apply paths refuse to emit an origin at all if the combination is somehow reached. Previously the two could be set together and any attacker origin was reflected alongside `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true` — the doc forbade the pairing, nothing enforced it, and `permissive().allow_credentials(true)` reached it in two calls.
- Request-signature verification no longer skips on a `starts_with` prefix of the raw target. `should_skip` matches whole segments of `path_only()` and rejects dot segments, so `/health../admin` and `/healthcheck-admin` no longer bypass verification.
- A signature timestamped in the future is rejected rather than treated as infinitely fresh; `saturating_sub` had clamped the age to zero.
- A disallowed preflight method returns `Forbidden` instead of a 204 with the header quietly omitted, and `Vary` is appended rather than overwritten.

### Changed — `0.1.3` → `0.1.4`

- Migrated onto `armature-core` `0.8`'s `Bytes`-backed request and response types. No behavior change beyond what that migration implies; see [`armature-core/CHANGELOG.md`](../armature-core/CHANGELOG.md).
- Request-signature verification reads the method through `method_str()`; signatures are unchanged.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-08-05

### Changed

- **Requires `armature-core` 0.9 (breaking).** The requirement moved `0.8` →
  `0.9`. `armature-core 0.9.0` itself moves `armature-h1` across a breaking
  0.x boundary; because `armature-core` types appear in this crate's own
  public API, the requirement change is breaking here too and the minor moves
  with it. Under Cargo's 0.x caret rules the 0.8 and 0.9 types are distinct
  and do not unify, so a consumer holding an `armature-core 0.8` type cannot
  pass it to this crate. Part of the `armature-core 0.9.0` release train; see
  `armature-core`'s CHANGELOG for the publish order.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-08-04

### Fixed

- Requirements on sibling armature crates name a minor instead of `0`. Under
  Cargo's 0.x rules `version = "0"` matches any release ever made, and edition
  2024 selects the MSRV-aware resolver, so a consumer declaring an older
  `rust-version` was handed the oldest version satisfying it — resolving
  `armature-core = "0"` on Rust 1.89 produced `armature-core 0.2.3` while an
  explicit `armature-core = "0.8"` elsewhere in the same graph pulled 0.8.2.
  Two copies of core, and a build failing on symbols the older one lacks. Each
  0.x minor in this family is a breaking change, so the requirement now names
  one. No API change.
